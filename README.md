This project is a casual sliding puzzle game developed in two weeks as part of a test assignment. The game architecture follows a hybrid approach, combining the ECS (for core gameplay logic) and DI  (to manage UI components and services). This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the game scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend.

**Features:**
* Classic Puzzle gameplay
* Currency System
* Multiple Themes Shop
* Game State Management
* Sound Management
* Save system

**Unity packages:**
* 2D Sprite & Animation
* TextMeshPro
* Unity UI

**3rd party plugins:**
* Leopotam ECS – Core game logic handling
* VContainer – DI for UI and services
* UniTask – Efficient asynchronous operations
* DOTween – Smooth animations
* Newtonsoft.Json – Data serialization

**Potential Improvements:**
* Monetization – Integration of Unity Ads and Unity Analytics
* Leaderboards & Social Features – Online leaderboards and integration with social media
* Gameplay Enhancements – Expanding difficulty settings and introducing advanced mechanics
* Improved UI/UX – Refining UI transitions and player interactions
* Cloud Save – Cross-device progress saving

By leveraging ECS for game mechanics and MVP with DI for UI and services, this project demonstrates a structured and modular architecture. With additional development time, monetization, social connectivity, and more complex gameplay elements could be integrated to further enhance the experience.
